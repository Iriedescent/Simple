		<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="grey" >My family is composed of my mother who is a housewife, my father who is the one mainly supporting us financially, and their four children, which are us. I have two sisters older than me and they both finished studying. The eldest one is an accountant who passed the board exam for CPA <em>(Certified Public Accountant)</em>, while the second one is a Computer Programmer. My youngest sibling is a boy who was diagnosed with autism. He is currently grade 9 studying in a certain special school.

The common thing among us is that we are all achievers. The medals in the picture at the side are the fruit of our hard work and continuous support of our parents.This are the treasure that we cherish and keep.

<p>Since I am quite introverted, my friends are limited in numbers. My closest and most trusted ones can only be counted with the fingers. These people some of those who made an impact to my life:
<ul>
	<li><img src="aby.jpg" width="100" height="150" align="right">I call her Aby or Abebe <em>(a portmanteau of her name and the term "pabebe")</em>. She is my longest and most trusted friend. I met her in grade 1 on the first day of school. Since our surname starts with the same letter, we are seatmate almost always. I shared most of my thoughts and secrets to her that sometimes, we can understand what each other were thinking with just a glance.</li>
	<li><img src="jenny.jpg" width="100" height="130" align="left">The second one is the person I met when I was in grade 4 but we just became close in high school. Her name is Jenny but we also call her Toni (nickname from her surname). She was the total opposite of me as she is very outgoing and friendly. The reason why we became close is because she is very fun to be with and I feel comfortable around her.</li>
		
	<li><img src="college.jpg"width="180"height="130"align="right"> The six people at the picture aside from me are the persons I met in college. They are Hanna, Danielle, Elaiza, Bernadette, Zelina, and Alleah. We are all blockmates but we stayed together up until now. If they are not here, I may have already transferred to another school by now. So I am very thankful for their existence.</li>
