			Hi! My name is Ina Marie Cabangon. I just turned 19 years old last August 28. Currently, I am studying Bachelor of Science in Psychology at De la Salle University- Dasmariñas. I am an alumnus in Bacoor National High School- Villa Maria Annex and Likha Molino Elementary School. I graduated as 2nd honorable mention in high school while I received <em> “huwarang bata”</em> award in elementary.</p> 
	<p>People describe me as introverted, shy, passive, quiet, or any word related to that. I like spending most of my time alone that’s why others often perceive me as someone who is hard to approach. In reality, I want to make friends but I just lack confidence. I like to relate with what others are feeling and try to understand their perspective. That is why studying psychology really help me to be open up with others.
